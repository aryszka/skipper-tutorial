nothing
404 page, general error
a service: display a file, no content -> create content, point out the problem of the not found on view
simplify the regexp to a modPath template
show how to 
display it as text/plain (comment on json)
different services: GET displays the file, POST changes the file
routes from etcd
different versions of the same service
different settings for the same service
protect services
protect etcd
bonus: SPA && api

make urls and update the hosts file
the redirect filter should use the the incoming schema from the request if not set
the double redirect should somehow changed, it would be nice if the path and status code would be modifiable on
the response and method on the request
rename get.go to show.go and set.go to update.go

[to skipper]
basic filters:
- set status
- http not taken as default scheme in redirect
- path parameters referenced as $name
https
