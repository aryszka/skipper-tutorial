demo:
nothing
404 page
a service: display a file
different services: GET displays the file, POST changes the file
different versions of the same services
different settings for the same services
routes from etcd
protect services
protect etcd

make urls and update the hosts file
the redirect filter should use the the incoming schema from the request if not set
the double redirect should somehow changed, it would be nice if the path and status code would be modifiable on
the response and method on the request
